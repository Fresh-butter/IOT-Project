How check_collision_risk and check_all_train_collisions are used:
check_collision_risk calculates collision risk between two trains based on their distance. This is used by check_all_train_collisions to compare all active train pairs.
check_all_train_collisions is called by:
The monitoring task (monitor_train_collisions) in monitor.py
The process_new_log function in train_service.py whenever a new location log is received
The dashboard API endpoints for collision risk analysis





How location functions are used:
calculate_distance_to_route is a helper function used by detect_route_deviations
detect_route_deviations is called by:
The monitoring task (monitor_train_deviations) in monitor.py
The update_train_progress function in tracking.py whenever a new location log is received
check_deviation_resolved is called by update_train_progress to create resolution alerts when trains return to their routes






How tracking functions are used:
get_active_trains_locations is called by dashboard endpoints for displaying train locations
detect_train_status_change is called by update_train_progress whenever a new location log is received
update_train_progress is the main function called by the process_new_log function in train_service.py to handle new train location data
Consistent Alert Creation Approach
Instead of using create_guest_copy=True parameter which creates duplicate alerts, we should explicitly create the exact alerts we need:



Each file now follows a consistent pattern that creates exactly one alert per recipient (train or guest) without any unintended duplicates.

Implementation Notes
These implementations provide:

monitor.py:

Background tasks to check for collisions, route deviations, and train status changes
Tracking of previous states to generate resolution alerts
System status reporting
Graceful startup and shutdown
Enhanced analytics.py:

Endpoint to view system status dashboard
Comprehensive dashboard data endpoint
Test endpoints for collision detection and route deviation
Simulation endpoint to manually create different types of alerts
These implementations follow your alert schema format and will work seamlessly with the collision.py, location.py, and tracking.py files we've already developed.

You can quickly test the system by:

Starting the API with uvicorn
Using Swagger UI at /docs to call the test endpoints
Using hardware to publish GPS coordinates that will trigger alerts
Examining the alerts in MongoDB or via the API

I am now going to test my hardware with my backend code, before that let's do some final checks, first I want that my backend logic ignores any data which is test data true , second only those trains which are in_service running or in_service stopped needs to be tracked , so how my hardware works is that it first makes the train in_service_running and then it starts sending logs and then when it reaches the final checkpoint it again goes into maintenance mode
